## Script

### 1. Hook (15 sec)
**Show landing page**
> "Businesses have $3 trillion locked in unpaid invoices. What if you could earn yield on that money while you wait to get paid? That's Faktory."

### 2. Live Rates Demo (15 sec)
**Scroll to Live Lendle Rates section**
> "These are real-time interest rates from Lendle Protocol on Mantle. Right now, USDC is earning [X]% APY. This is where your invoice value can work for you."

### 3. Connect Wallet (10 sec)
**Click Connect Wallet, approve in MetaMask**
> "Let's connect a wallet and create an invoice."

### 4. Mint Invoice (45 sec)
**Click Launch App > Go to Mint page**
> "Here I'm creating a new invoice. $10,000 due in 30 days from 'Acme Corp'. Notice the privacy option - the invoice details are hashed, so sensitive business data stays private."

**Fill form and submit**
> "One click to mint it as an NFT on Mantle. Transaction fees are under a cent."

### 5. Deposit to Yield Vault (30 sec)
**Go to Dashboard, click Deposit on the new invoice**
> "Now I'll deposit this invoice to the yield vault. I can choose conservative or aggressive strategies."

**Select strategy and confirm**
> "The AI agent will now optimize my yield 24/7."

### 6. Agent Monitor (30 sec)
**Go to Agent tab**
> "Here's the AI agent dashboard. It monitors deposits every 30 seconds, checks market conditions using Pyth oracle data, and automatically adjusts strategies. Watch the live activity feed..."

**Point to stats**
> "It requires 80% confidence before auto-executing decisions, and you can always override."

### 7. Why Mantle (20 sec)
> "Why Mantle? This agent makes 2,880 transactions per day. On Ethereum that would cost $100+. On Mantle, it's 50 cents. Sub-cent transaction costs make real-time AI optimization viable."

### 8. Close (15 sec)
**Show landing page stats**
> "Faktory: Turn your invoices into yield. Built on Mantle, powered by Lendle, secured by Pyth. Thank you."

## Key Points to Emphasize
- **Real yield** from Lendle (not token emissions)
- **Privacy** - commitment hashes, not plaintext data
- **AI agent** - autonomous, 24/7, real-time
- **Mantle economics** - sub-cent tx costs enable the agent

## Fallbacks
- If transactions are slow: "Mantle testnet may be congested, but mainnet is fast"
- If rates show N/A: "The frontend caches rates, they'll appear shortly"
